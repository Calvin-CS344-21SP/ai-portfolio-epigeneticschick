# Narrative Explorations

The notebooks in this section deal with medium-length story arcs--longer than the [../fundamentals](Fundamentals) notebooks but shorter than projects.
They include both mostly-in-class explorations ("Lab") and mostly-at-home applications ("Homework").

Index:

* `lab02` *Pull the Chain*: A physical analogy for loss functions and gradient descent (*optional to include here*)
* `lab03` *Estimating Proportions with SGD*: Working out the bugs to train a simple model
* `hw02` *Digit Classification*: Use the famous MNIST dataset to train models, both at a high level and a low level.
